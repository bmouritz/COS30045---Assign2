            <h2>The Correlation Between Waste And GDP</h2>
            <p id="homebody">Here we want to investigate if there's any correlation between increasing GDP and the increase in the countries total waste output.<br/>
                We will start by going through basic sustainable pratices in waste management,<br/>
                Then explaining the basic of GDP.<br/>
                Following this, we will present Australia's waste output by each State.<br/>
                Then look into each States waste output and their GSP. <br/>
                Finally, we will look into the worlds GDP and waste outputs to see if there is any correlation.

            <h3>Sustainable Practices in Waste Management</h3>
            <p id="homebodyp">Humans generate a lot of waste, much of which now affects the air we breathe, the water we drink, and land on which we live.<br/><br/> According to the United Nations,
                about <a href="https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/news/sustainable-waste-management-opportunity-not-burden-head-un-environments">11.2 billion tonnes</a> of solid waste is collected worldwide, almost all of which comes from humans alone. <br/><br/>
                We therefore not only need to manage this waste but also come up with strategies that will manage such waste sustainably. <br/>
                This article will talk about sustainable waste management, its importance and said strategies for sustainable waste management.<br/><br/>
                Waste management refers to the practice of collecting, transporting, processing or disposing of, managing and monitoring various waste materials. <br/><br/>
                It is important to observe sustainability in this aspect so that every bit of waste can be managed in an efficient manner rather than just dumping it all in landfills.</p>

            <h3>What Is GDP?</h3>
            <img src="../Assign2/media/gdp.jpg" id="imgbody2p" />
            <p id="homebody2p">Gross Domestic Product growth may once have indicated good fortune for the vast majority of Americans, but over the past several decades, many Americans were left increasingly behind. <br/><br/>
                This reality is masked by a widely shared misunderstanding of what average growth really means for individual people. <br/><br/>
                Growth tells us little about who actually prospers when the economy grows. <br/><br/>
                As such, policymakersâ€™ diagnoses of the U.S. economy, and their prescriptions for what ails it, are based on the wrong metric.</p>
